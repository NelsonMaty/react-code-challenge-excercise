# A React Code Challenge

This project is the result of a React Code Challenge I completed during an interview.
I was given a partially functioning project and tasked with adding some features and writing unit tests.

# Tech stack

- ReactJS
- MaterialUI
- Emotion
- ReduxJS
- Jest
- Typescript

# Follow along

This project is designed for you to follow along easily. Here are the features I was asked to implement:

Req #1: Implement a card layout. Add unit test.
Req #2: Select a random computer player. Add unit test.
Req #3: Calculate and display the winner. Add unit test.

I’ve completed these tasks and created separate pull requests (PRs) for each feature and test, making it easier for you to review or compare with your own code.
Here are the links to the PRs:

| Requirement  | Type     | Link |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 1    | Feature   |  https://github.com/NelsonMaty/ReactCodeChallenge/pull/1 |

| 2    | Feature   |  https://github.com/NelsonMaty/ReactCodeChallenge/pull/3 |
| 2    | Unit test |  https://github.com/NelsonMaty/ReactCodeChallenge/pull/4 |
| 3    | Feature   |  https://github.com/NelsonMaty/ReactCodeChallenge/pull/5 |
| 3    | Unit test |  https://github.com/NelsonMaty/ReactCodeChallenge/pull/6 |


# Installation

Since this is a regular [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) project, the commands should look familiar.

To install the dependencies, simply run:
```
npm i
```

# Usage

This project has both a backend and frontend. Let’s start by running the server:

```
npm run serve:data
```

You should see a console message like this:

```
JSON server is running.
```

Next, start the client by running:

```
npm run dev
```

That’s it! You should now see the React app in action.
If it doesn’t open automatically, you can manually go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
