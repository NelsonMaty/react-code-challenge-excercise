# A React Code Challenge

This project is the result of a React Code Challenge that I took while performing an interview.  
I was presented with a project that was partially working. I was asked to add some features and code some unit tests.

# Installation

Being a regular [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) project, you can expect its commands to be familiar.
For installing dependencies, run:

```
npm i
```

# Usage

This project has a backend and a frontend. First, let's run the server:

```
npm run serve:data
```

You should see a console message like this:

```
JSON server is running.
```

Now let's run the client:

```
npm run dev
```

That's it! You should be able to see the React app in action.
If not, open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

# Follow along

This project is meant to be followed along with the instructions.  
I've created branchs where each step is a separate PR.

Here you can find the links to the PRs:

# Requirements

1. Feature #1: Implement card layout. Add united test.
2. Feature #2: Select random computer player. Add unit test.
3. Feature #3: Calculate and display the winner. Add unit test.
